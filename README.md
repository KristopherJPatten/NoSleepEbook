The NoSleep eBook is the quarterly collection of the best stories from the subreddit NoSleep. These stories are decided on by a vote from the community and stories are collected in a free ebook.
I was a moderator for NoSleep until 2019, with a particular focus on running the contests and creating the ebooks. On this hub, you'll find all the ebooks from 2011 until the end of my time as a moderator.
Ebooks are always intended to be free as the authors, artists, and editor are not compensated for the work presented here and are providing it as a service to those who enjoy creepy stories.
